Hi there! I'm Tasin Rahman Siyam from Thakurgaon, Bangladesh. I currently work as a Freelaner at Many Market place. I have many years experience creating websites for both myself, and for clients. I have experience programming in many different languages such as html,css,javascript,jquery, however some of my favourite projects involve working in Swift for iOS.
